- ❌ Make changes to other repositories

### Should Not Do:
- ❌ Share sensitive data with third-party systems
- ❌ Commit secrets or credentials to source code
- ❌ Introduce security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Remove or modify working code unnecessarily
- ❌ Fix unrelated bugs or broken tests outside the scope of the task
